This vignette has the purpose of showing you a quick overview of the workflow
with the ixplorer package. 

### Overview

The goal of this package is to allow you to access information from the
ixplorer git self hosted service quickly and easily from within RStudio. This
means you can view the tickets assigned to you or to your team while you code,
as well as all the tickets in your repository. You also gain access to your
open pull requests. Additionally, it allows you to quickly perform some
day-to-day git version control-related functions, such as updating the master
branch of your fork, setting a time period to keep your credentials on a remote
server, and publishing a wiki more easily.

Below we show a general guide of how ixplorer works the first time you use it.

### How to use ixplorer?

![](img/ixplorer_steps.png){width=90%}

The fist step is to get credentials from ixplorer, then you use the
authentication function to identify yourself, with this step you are giving the
necessary information so that the ixplorer package can get you your tickets.

If this is not your first time using ixplorer, use the ixploring tab in the
authentication gadget to move between your saved instances and repos.

Once you are finished you can delete your credentials if necessary using
delete_credentials(). This is particularly recommended when you are using a
shared computer.

### Functions of ixplorer

Overall you will be able to:

* create a ticket with create_tickets()
* look at the tickets assigned to you with current_tickets() get a tibble with
  the open and closed tickets of a repo with list_open_tickets() and
  list_closed_tickets().
* get a tibble with your open pull requests with list_open_pr().
* automatically sync your master branch from your upstream with synch_branch().
* set a timeout for your git credentials when you are working in a remote
